# Workout-Tracker

The Workout Tracker is an extremely user friendly application that allows the user to log, track, and view their daily workouts. The user is able to log multiple workouts in a single day. They can enter all the details within each type of exercise (i.e. Tracking the name, distance + duration for a cardio workout; Tracking the name, weight (lbs), sets + reps, and duration for resistance training). The Dashboard tab has a page called 'Workout Dashboard' where the user can view their daily workouts they have logged.
